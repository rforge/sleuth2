\title{Therapeutic Marijuana}
\description{
  To investigate the capacity of marijuana to reduce the side effects of
  cancer chemotherapy, researchers performed a double-blind, randomized,
  crossover trial.  Fifteen cancer patients on chemotherapy were
  randomly assigned to receive either a marijuana treatment or a placebo
  treatment after their first three sessions of chemotherapy.  They were
  then crossed over to the opposite treatment for their next 3 sessions.
