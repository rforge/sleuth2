\title{Birdkeeping and Lung Cancer}
\description{
  A 1972--1981 health survey in The Hague, Netherlands, discovered an
  association between keeping pet birds and increased risk of lung
  cancer.  To investigate birdkeeping as a risk factor, researchers
  conducted a \emph{case--control} study of patients in 1985 at four
  hospitals in The Hague (population 450,000).  They identified 49 cases
  of lung cancer among the patients who were registered with a general
  practice, who were age 65 or younger and who had resided in the city
  since 1965.  They also selected 98 controls from a population of
  residents having the same general age structure.
