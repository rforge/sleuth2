\title{Religious Competition}
\description{
  Adam Smith, in Wealth of Nations, observed that even religious
  monopolies become weak when they are not challenged by competition.
  Data to illustrate this point is from 21 countries in which the
  percentages of Catholics in the populations varied from a low 1.2\% to
  a high 97.6\%.
