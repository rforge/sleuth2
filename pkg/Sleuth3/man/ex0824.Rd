\title{Respiratory Rates for Children}
\description{
  A high respiratory rate is a potential diagnostic indicator of
  respiratory infection in children.  To judge whether a respiratory
  rate is \dQuote{high} however, a physician must have a clear picture of the
  distribution of normal rates.  To this end, Italian researchers
  measured the respiratory rates of 618 children between the ages of 15
  days and 3 years.
