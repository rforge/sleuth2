\title{Biological Pest Control}
\description{
  In a study of the effectiveness of biological control of the exotic
  weed tansy ragwort, researchers manipulated the exposure to the
  ragwort flea beetle on 15 plots that had been planted with a high
  density of ragwort.  Harvesting the plots the next season, they
  measured the average dry mass of ragwort remaining (grams/plant) and
  the flea beetle load (beetles/gram of ragwort dry mass) to see if the
  ragwort plants in plots with high flea beetle loads were smaller as a
  result of herbivory by the beetles.
